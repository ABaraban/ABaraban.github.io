            <h1>Choosing Between Roth and Traditional Retirement Accounts</h1>
            <p><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i> June 2024</p>

            <p>
                A common question for people saving for retirement is whether to contribute to a <b>Roth IRA</b> (post-tax) or a <b>Traditional IRA</b> (pre-tax). 
                At its core, this choice is a bet on what your <b>tax rate will be now vs. in retirement</b>.
            </p>

            <h2>The Essential Tradeoff</h2>
            <p>
                With a <b>Traditional IRA</b>, you deduct your contribution from your income today, reducing current taxes. Your investments grow tax-deferred. When you withdraw, you pay income tax on both contributions and earnings.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a <b>Roth IRA</b>, you contribute money you've already paid taxes on. Your investments grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals are completely tax-free in retirement.
            </p>

            <h2>The Tax Equation</h2>
            <p>
                Suppose you can contribute $C$ dollars now. Let's compare what you'll have to spend in retirement from each account, ignoring investment limits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Let $T_0$ = your marginal tax rate today</li>
                <li>Let $T_1$ = your marginal tax rate at withdrawal (retirement)</li>
                <li>Let $r$ = investment rate of return, $n$ = years until withdrawal</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <b>Traditional IRA:</b><br>
                You contribute <i>pre-tax</i> dollars. The account grows to $C(1 + r)^n$. On withdrawal, you pay taxes:
            </p>
            <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
                After-tax amount: \( C(1 + r)^n \times (1 - T_1) \)
            </div>
            <p>
                <b>Roth IRA:</b><br>
                You pay taxes upfront, so the initial contribution is smaller:
            </p>
            <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
                After-tax dollars to invest: \( C \times (1 - T_0) \) <br>
                Account grows to: \( C(1 - T_0) \times (1 + r)^n \)
            </div>

            <h3>Which is better?</h3>
            <p>
                The Roth and Traditional IRAs are <i>equivalent</i> <b>if and only if</b> your tax rate in retirement is the same as it is today ($T_0 = T_1$):
            </p>
            <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
                \( C(1 + r)^n (1 - T_1) = C(1 - T_0)(1 + r)^n \)<br>
                So, the only thing that matters is whether \(T_1\) is greater or less than \(T_0\).
            </div>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you expect your tax rate in retirement <b>to be higher</b> than today (\(T_1 > T_0\)), Roth is better.</li>
                    <li>If you expect your tax rate <b>to drop</b> in retirement (\(T_1 &lt; T_0\)), Traditional is better.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Other Considerations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Required Minimum Distributions: Traditional accounts force you to withdraw at a certain age, Roth IRAs do not.</li>
                <li>Contribution/income limits may affect your eligibility for either account type.</li>
                <li>Roth IRAs offer flexibility (no tax on qualified withdrawals at any age), which can be beneficial if you need funds early.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                Most of the time, the Roth vs. Traditional choice simply comes down to asking: <b>Do you expect to pay a higher or lower tax rate in retirement?</b> 
                If you expect higher taxes later, the Roth is more attractive. If you expect lower taxes, Traditional is generally better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Splitting contributions between both types can add flexibility if you're unsure. And as always, individual situations may varyâ€”this framework helps clarify what's truly at stake!
