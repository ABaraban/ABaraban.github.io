            <h1>Choosing Between Roth and Traditional Retirement Accounts</h1>
            <p><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i> July 2025</p>

            <p>
                Should you use a <b>Roth IRA</b> (post-tax) or a <b>Traditional IRA</b> (pre-tax) for retirement? At its core, this choice is a bet on whether your <b>tax rate will be higher or lower in retirement</b> than it is now.
            </p>

            <h2>The Essential Tradeoff</h2>
            <p>
                A <b>Traditional IRA</b> lets you deduct your contribution today, lowering your current taxes. Your investments grow tax-deferred, and you pay income tax when you withdraw in retirement.<br>
                A <b>Roth IRA</b> is funded with money after you’ve already paid taxes. Your investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free.
            </p>

            <h2>The Tax Equation</h2>
            <p>
                Suppose you contribute an initial amount <b>C</b>, earning an annual return <b>r</b> for <b>n</b> years. Let:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>T<sub>0</sub></b> = your marginal tax rate today</li>
                <li><b>T<sub>1</sub></b> = your marginal tax rate at withdrawal (retirement)</li>
                <li><b>r</b> = investment rate of return</li>
                <li><b>n</b> = years until withdrawal</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Traditional IRA:</b> After-tax withdrawal:</p>
            <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
                \[
                \text{After-tax amount} = C(1 + r)^n \times (1 - T_1)
                \]
            </div>
            <p><b>Roth IRA:</b> After-tax withdrawal:</p>
            <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
                \[
                \text{After-tax amount} = C \times (1 - T_0) \times (1 + r)^n
                \]
            </div>

            <h3>Which is better?</h3>
            <p>
                The two options are <i>economically equivalent</i> if and only if your tax rate is the same at contribution and withdrawal (<b>T<sub>0</sub></b> = <b>T<sub>1</sub></b>). So your decision is mainly this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you expect your tax rate in retirement <b>to be higher</b> than today (<b>T<sub>1</sub></b> &gt; <b>T<sub>0</sub></b>), Roth is better.</li>
                <li>If you expect your tax rate <b>to drop</b> in retirement (<b>T<sub>1</sub></b> &lt; <b>T<sub>0</sub></b>), Traditional is better.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Other Considerations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Required Minimum Distributions: Traditional accounts force you to withdraw at a certain age; Roth IRAs do not.</li>
                <li>Income and contribution limits may affect which accounts you're eligible for.</li>
                <li>Roth IRAs offer withdrawal flexibility, which may be helpful if you need funds early.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                For most people, the Roth vs. Traditional choice simply comes down to: <b>Do you expect to pay a higher or lower tax rate in retirement?</b> 
                If you expect higher taxes later, the Roth is more attractive; if lower, Traditional is generally better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Splitting contributions between both adds flexibility if you’re unsure. As always, individual situations vary—this framework clarifies the key point!
